A huge amount of what Eliezer talks about in the Sequences is actually a lot easier to understand as applications of Looking. Not all of it, and maybe not even most of it: quite a bit of it is training and using a certain kind of mathematical thinking. But the stuff about actually changing your mind is\\u2026 well, it can't work reliably by mental/emotional force the way I hear so very many rationalists talking, and it's now super obvious to me why. It's really easy if you know how to Look. As in, I think it's the natural thing you want to do if you can Look at your own mind.\\nRelated: I seem to have developed Looking well enough to track my own subconscious strategies. Turns out, nearly everyone runs sexual or social schemes below conscious awareness for strategic reasons. (This is where \\\"load-bearing bugs\\\" come from, and why meaningful change is so hard.) I'm no exception \\u2014 and some of my strategies were hurting people I cared about, and I was motivated not to notice. And once I did notice, those same strategies wanted to rearrange to do some kind of remorseful thing that was still in line with the same strategies but had many surface features of a deep emotional realization. Actually Looking made this whole gibberish easy to track and work around. This let me meaningfully mend a relationship with an ex I saw I had badly mistreated such that we're now very good friends. (I'm still reaching out to others I've hurt and working on mending things\\u2026 but it's tricky to convey that and how I've changed, so this is currently slow-going.)\\nI'm in the process of restructuring some of the CFAR material to account for what I can now readily see about how minds work. I haven't been able to convey the core insight, but it does seem to make a pretty deeply profound impact on a lot of people. On the surface it looks something like \\\"No, really, you're a game theoretic agent\\\" and then following the implications. But the reason for this was because I knew this would impact a particular slice of the CFAR participant population more deeply in a particular way, and I was right. (Doing follow-ups with dear folk from Prague to verify. In many cases it worked slightly better than expected.)\\nI now have a deep, deep, deep reservoir of energy I can call on whenever I need. I don't usually do this because I can also tell what the consequences are of using that reservoir. But if I need it, I have no doubt I can just go for 36+ hours at high function. I've tested that a few times and it works damn well \\u2014 but it's still unkind to my body, so I don't care to do it.\\nIt's waaaaaaaay easier for me to hold emotional space for others. Way way way easier. I'm basically not suffering, I see their suffering so very much more clearly, and most of my self-consciousness about being in connection with others is\\u2026 hmm, I want to say \\\"gone\\\" but maybe \\\"irrelevant\\\" is a better description. I slip in this sometimes, when I forget how to Look and fall into old habits\\u2026 but that's happening vanishingly more rarely as time goes on.\\nI can form deep, deep pacts with others who know how to Look. This is harder to explain, but I can point to an analogy clearly, I think: if you're in the cell phone world and you see someone else who has figured out how to look up, there's a kind of deep collaboration you two can do, and a level of communication you can have, that others literally cannot understand pre-kensh\\u014D. In the real-world analog, this creates room for a kind of bond that lets us sidestep most primate political baloney, because there's common knowledge that we can both Look at all that stuff, and that that's not what's important.\"), mdx(\"ul\", null, mdx(\"li\", {\n    parentName: \"ul\"\n  })));\n}\n;\nMDXContent.isMDXComponent = true;","excerpt":"https://lesswrong.com/posts/tMhEv28KJYWsu6Wdo/kensh “I’m okay.
